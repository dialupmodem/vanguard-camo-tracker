# vanguard-camo-tracker
## About this project
This was a learning/refresher project I mostly built for personal use. I published it here in hopes that somebody other than me would find some use out of it. It was built using Vue.js 2, Axios, and Vuex, there's a complimentary API project that facilitates data access. That can be found here: [repo coming soon]

It's currently built as a sinlge-user application. There's a possibility of this changing in the future, we'll see what develops.

## What it does
It's a simple utiilty for tracking weapon challenge/camo progress in Vanguard. I was frustrated with the game's inability to view weapon challenges during a match so I created this utility to help remedy that.

The application has a listing of weapons divided into their respective category (Assault Rifles, SMGs, etc.) and allows selection of a weapon to modify the current progress for each of that weapon's challenges.
